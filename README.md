## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The main objective of this project is to organize and analyze data Louise collected from others fundraising campaigns in order to determine how some factors impact the success of a campaign like the play Fever she needs to fund.
Specifically, we need to analyze how a successful campaign is related with their launch dates and their funding goals. Knowing what impact have these factors help Louise to make good decision about when to start her campaign and how much is a good goal she can set. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the project instructions, Pivot tables and graphing were the tools used to visualize the relation between factors stated above and the success of a campaign. So, a Pivot table that shows the relation between the month of the year and the outcome ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") was built.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Additionally, a second table shows the relation between the campaign goal and its outcome based on some dollar-amount ranges. Two line- charts helped to visualize and understand the results in a better way.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The organization the data from the data set used did not have any big issue but the knowledge of Excel functionalities. Going to Excel documentation was the way helped me to overcome this issue. Analysis is real challenge because it would be helpful to be more familiar with this kind of projects in order to have better understanding.
## Results
The line graph shows that the best date to launch a successful campaign is around May and June. Maybe June should be the month when Louise must launch her campaign. November and December are months when a campaign could be less successful
The failed campaigns follow a steady course so we can affirm that the launch month doesn’t have a close relation with this outcome as well as the cancelled campaigns do 
Percentages of successful and failed campaigns don´t follow a clear course so it is possible affirm that there is not an evident relation between the outcome and the goal ranges. What is evident is that as greater a goal is the probability of success is lesser although on the biggest range the chart shows a great peak because 100% of projects were successful
